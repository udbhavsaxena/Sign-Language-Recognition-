-----------Files To Acquire---------------
	-SignLanguageProject.ipynb: Github repository: https://github.com/udbhavsaxena/CSE676---Sign-Language-Recognition-.git: refer to 	reference [11]
	-MP5_Data, projsen.h5, Real Time Result.mp4: all these files are in Google Drive, link in the report under references: refer to 	reference [12]
	Drive Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oe0xmAVAKe01WwveFdFalA31qXrzomSS?usp=sharing 
	Refer to acquiring files in the last page in the report under Reference Section 
	
	NOTE: MP5_Data is large file but it will be available on the drive link

------------HOW TO RUN THE CODE---------------

Download all the files into one folder and make sure that the root directory is this folder so that these files are accessible by the python environment. 
Every cell that has the comment #RUN and the sequence mentioned should be run as it is.
On the other hand, every cell that #OPTIONAL is not necessary for verifying the model. 
The cells that have #OPTIONAL written on it were the constructors used to make the model.
So, it is not necessary for running the #OPTIONAL but if someone want to train a new gesture model
from scratch then optional part is also necessary for modelling. 

This folder also contains a video file that has the screen-recording of how the model works in real-time.
